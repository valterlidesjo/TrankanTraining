<p align="left">This is a PHP project for studying purposes. I wanted to learn PHP and this was my first PHP and MySQL project. <br><br>I enjoy training as a hobby so I made a training website. It's made with HTML, PHP and CSS as frond end and the backend is PHP and MySQL for the database. <br><br>Trånkan Training is a training website made to motivate you to train better and harder to get good results. It has a webshop with fake products, a sign up system and a profile page for users where they can set a profile picture and set their height and weight in order to track their training results.<br><br>The backend is built with PHP and signs up the user and saves and encrypt the user info with MySQL.</p>
